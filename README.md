I'm a Computer Science student, and honestly, I'm just really into learning as much as I can. What truly clicks for me is backend programming â€“ I just find it super cool how all the magic happens behind the scenes. Here is a collection of personal projects, because it's how I learn new stuff and have fun doing it.
