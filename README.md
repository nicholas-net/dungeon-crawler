DungeonApp

A Simple Text-Based Dungeon Crawler Game

This is my very first text-based game! I built it to learn about Java programming, how to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and how to make a basic game run in the terminal.

How to Run It

    Download the code: You can click the green "Code" button on this GitHub page and choose "Download ZIP," or use Git if you know how:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/nicholas-net/dungeon-crawler.git

    Open the project: Open the dungeon-crawler folder (which contains IdeaProjects/DungeonApp) in your Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.

    Run the program: In your IDE, navigate to src/DungeonApp.java, right-click on it, and select "Run 'DungeonApp.main()'".

What I Learned

    How to use classes and objects to organize game elements like Hero, Room, and Monster.

    Making different parts of the program interact with each other (like combat between a hero and a monster).

    Getting user input from the keyboard to control the game.

    Implementing random elements for varied gameplay, like monster spawns and item drops.
